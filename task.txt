/* 
  Implement a component called ItemCounter 
  that provides the following functionality:
 
- Displays a current number of “Items.” Initially, there are zero items.
- Has an “Add Item” button that increases the Items count by one. 
And a “Remove Item” button that decreases the count by one.
- When the number of Items is 10 or greater, the displayed item count should be “10+”. 
But behind the scenes, the real item count should be maintained.
- Allows a parent component to specify:
- Whether this component is enabled or not. When the component is not enabled, 
the background color is gray (instead of white), and the buttons are disabled.
- A function that will be called when another button, “Process”, is clicked.
